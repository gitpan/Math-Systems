SYNOPSIS
      use Math::Systems;
      $a = Math::Systems->new(
         [1,  2,   3],
         [1,  -2 ,  -3],
      )
      @solutions = $a->solve;

DESCRIPTION
    Solves systems of equations using Krammer's rule. If you look at the
    Solve method you'll understand Krammer's rule (I think?)

    Basically a system of equations is more than one equation/variable your
    solving. This module REQUIRES you have 1 equation per each coefficent.
    Try not to use too many equations. 3 equations is probably the limit of
    reason. But if you don't mind long compilation time, go for as many as
    you want.

    This module uses (and ovbiously requires you have) Math::Matrix to do
    all the Matrix work. Please take a look at that module for details do
    you can see exactly what is happening. There are no arguements in this
    module except for the Matrix which will be brought to Math::Matrix.

    Also, keep in mind, there are no error messenging. I will of course
    change that someday, but for now I'm satisfied that I can solve systems
    of equations. Don't allow error-prone things to be written in. But,
    there are of course times when you won't be able to figure out the
    stupid answer and this module will absolutly act like it did a great
    job, and at the same time, fail. So, keep that in mind.

    BETA means something. It's not good.

METHODS
  new

    Pass the Equation coeffients/answers to this. The same way you do it in
    Math::Matrix. This is the constructor. If the equations are 2x + 3y = 10
    and 3x + 2y = 10 then

         Math::Systems->new(
               [2, 3, 10],
               [3, 2, 10]
         );

  solve

    Solves it. Returns list of solutions in order. Take no arguements. Ever.
